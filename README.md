This project will be a tic-tac-toe game. 

It will be very simple, the user will be able to play two player or against a CPU. It will follow the Unix design because there will be seperate parts that will control the gameboard and a part that will be an algarithm for the CPU. The CPU move only outputs a number that the GUI will use to place a piece. This is very much a Unix design where the GUI and logic are seperate but are put together with a thin layer of glue.
